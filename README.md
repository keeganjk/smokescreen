## What is it?
Smokescreen is a simple JavaScript program that randomly opens sites from a long list of popular URLs from many categories. This will act as a mask, or "smokescreen" over your browsing history, to troll, confuse, and confound the prying eyes of those who may be spying on your browser history.
### Why?
In 2017, the US president signed a bill that would allow ISPs to obtain access to your browser history and sell it to whoever they please. This could mean government agencies, large advertisement businesses, or if they really wanted to, your creepy neighbor next-door. This will make it more difficult for your ISPs to find or sell real history to others, thus preventing your information from being compromised.

<hr>

> ### 3. Open 'index.htm'
> Open <code>index.htm</code> with any web modern browser.
> ![Clicking on index.htm](https://github.com/keeganjk/smokescreen/blob/master/images/index.GIF?raw=true "")

<hr>

> ### 4. Enable JavaScript and Pop-ups
> After opening <code>index.htm</code>, you have to enable pop-ups and JavaScript (for <code>index.htm</code>).
> This will be different in every browser, but it is usually in Settings.
> JavaScript will most likely be enabled, but Pop-ups may be disabled.

<hr>

> ### 5. Set Wait Time and Click Start
> Click the button that says "Set Wait Time" and then set a time to wait in milliseconds between page closes.
> Next, click the button that says, "Start!" and random pages will randomly open and close.
> To stop the process, close the page with "Smokescreen" in the title.
> > <b>WARNING! If you have a data limit, do not use this program unless you expect to be charged or prevented from continuing web browsing; this uses random page generation to pollute, or make a "smokescreen" over your browser history. Also, putting the wait time too low can cause crashes, denial-of-service to yourself, and difficulty to stop the script.</b>
